title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

#|fig-cap:"This figure shows the relationship between the temperature at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM in the 3 locations; Hobart, Uluru, and Wollogong. The x-axis shows the temperature at 3:00 pm, y-axis shows the temperature at 9:00 am, and the colors differentiate the location." 
#|fig_alt:" This visualization is a scatter plot with 3 different colors that represent each location and their correlating temperatures. The biggest takeaways are that the there is a medium/strong and positive relationship in all of the locations, and that Uluru has typically the greatest temperatures. The data is from weather-"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv"

ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) +
